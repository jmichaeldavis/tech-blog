# Tech Blog

## Description
This project is a MVC model application. It is a tech blog that allows a user to either log in or sign up, view all blog posts on the home page, view their own posts on the dashboard, and create new blog posts. The styling and project was based off the skeleton of a group project and then changed to work for this project. However, it ended up being more difficult to refactor the code rather than create it from scratch. Lesson learned. The styling and functionality could use more work to make it more user-friendly.

## Installation and Usage
To use this, the user must do 'npm i' to install the packages, run the schema.sql and run npm run seeds to add the database. Afterwards, running 'node server.js' will launch the local server. The user can then log in or sign up. The home page will display all the blog posts. Going to the dashboard will show the posts made by the user and will allow them to create a new post.
